## Tools

| Name                                          | Purpose                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Linux Ubuntu 16.04                            | This is my OS of choice for this project. Most of the frameworks and resources that will be useful in this project are most strongly supported on Ubuntu. This makes it a lot easier. 18.04 Might still be a bit too new though. |
| Python 3.6                                    | I pick Python 3 because support for Python 2 is already in sunset mode. Also, the new features in 3.6 (in particular strong typing and string formatting with a prefix) are very helpful. |
| [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) | This is my code editor and integrated IDE of choice. As the project gets bigger, I want the IDE to have my back. It helps with code hinting, refactoring, formatting, resolving compile errors, best practice suggestions, and testing. VSCode is another great choice. |
| [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)       | My Git GUI client of choice. Not super important for this project since I probably don't need to do anything too fancy with versioning or merging here. It feels very intuitive to me, but still being very powerful and letting me do what I want easily. |
| [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)  | This is my Python environment manager. I use it to create and manage virtual environments. It is lightweight and reliable. However, once inside my environment I still use `pip` exclusively to install packages. |
| [Typora](https://typora.io/)                  | Writing a good README and documentation is important for any project, even if it for my own sake later on. The dominant documentation format is `.md` files, and Typora is my editor of choice for that purpose. |
